Add front end dropdown for toggling and saving of units and measurements.

== Description ==

**Why Unit Switcher?**

Units provides your users with a way to choose and display their preferred unit of measurement on the fly. The user's preferred unit of measurement is saved via session, cookie, or none â€“ configurable under the plugin settings. 

One example of usage would be for a real estate listing website. If land size is stored as acres, it may be helpful to provide a method for users to toggle between acres and kilometers squared as their preferred method of measurement. Another example may be a recipe site, where it may be helpful to provide users with a way to toggle between ingredient measurement units.

Units may be added as needed, along with alternate units and the conversion formulas.

Visit [unitswitcher.com](http://unitswitcher.com) for more detailed information.

**Using Units**

First, add primary units under settings > Units. Alternate units may be added by providing their name, singular name and conversion formula. Multiple alternate units may be set.

Use the function `unit_switcher($variable, $primaryunit)` in your template to display the switcher. Pass the stored value as the first paramter and primary unit of measurement as the second value.

To display a single switcher, the shortcode [unit_switcher] is available for use. The shortcode requires two parameters, `unit` (the primary unit being converted) and `value` (the stored value).

**Important: Unit Switcher requires WordPress version 3.8 or higher, and PHP version 5.3.2 or higher.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin WPML compatible? =
The plugin is not yet WPML compatible.

= How do I add a unit of measurement? =
Visit Settings > Unit Switcher. A primary unit of measurement is required, along with at least one alternate unit. Substitute the primary unit with `X` in the formula to equal the alternate formula. So, to set an alternate unit of `inches` for a primary unit of `feet`, the formula should be set to `X*12`.

2. Optionally save the user's preference via the session or cookie.
